# CS-360-Mobile-Architect-And-Programming

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 360: Mobile Arcitecture & Programming at Southern New Hampshire University.

For this project, I developed an inventory app for a warehouse enviornment. This app tracks products in a warehouse's inventory, allowing management and employees to view and adjust the quantity and location of different items in a warehouse. To develop this app, I needed to first develop a back-end database for storing information like user login credentials and items in the warehouse. Once developed, I created the front-end for this application. For this project, I developed the app for Android using Android Studio using Java. The app features a user login page where existing users can authenticate and new users can register. Once logged in, the user is taken to a Grid of all the items in the warehouses inventory. Using native UI elements, the users can add new items as they are delivered, fetch informationa about these items from the database, adjust item details, and delete items from the warehouse. Users can also enable SMS notifications in a setting panel. Should the user opt in to SMS notifications, they will recieve low quanity alerts for items in their warehouse. This will assist employees and managers of the warehouse to make sure items never run out of stock without someone being aware of it.
